# WoollyM: PHP Dataframes for Data Analysis library

WoollyM is a PHP library for data analysis. It can be used to represent tabular data from various sources _(CSV, database, json, Excel...)_. The unified API can then be used easily to browse, analyze, modify, and export data in a variety of formats, we try to provide a very playful, modern, expressive, and user-friendly interface. This API is also modular and extensible, so you can easily add your own calculation and exploration methods.

Performances are optimized to be as light as possible on RAM during operations (input, output, read, write, stats, copy, clone), this is done using - internally - complex iterators and optimization preferring RAM over speed (even if we try to be fast also). The storage engine uses a modular storage system, if the default PhpArray driver uses RAM, the use of a database driver (such as the PDO driver) theoretically allows you to work on extremely large datasets. Using appropriate drivers, you can also write - for example - directly to the database (add, update) using the Wolly API.

## Installation

### Using Composer:

```sh
composer require mammothphp/woollym
```

### Requirements
 - PHP 8.3 or higher
 - php_mbstring extension

### License
 - [BSD-3-Clause](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)

## Data Format Examples

### Instantiating from an array:

```php
$df = DataFrame::fromArray([
    ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3],
    ['a' => 4, 'b' => 5, 'c' => 6],
    ['a' => 7, 'b' => 8, 'c' => 9],
]);
```


### Extracting the underlying two-dimensional array:

```php
$myArray = $df->toArray();
print_r($myArray);
```

```php
[
    [0] => [
            [a] => 1
            [b] => 2
            [c] => 3
        ]

    [1] => [
            [a] => 4
            [b] => 5
            [c] => 6
        ]

    [2] => [
            [a] => 7
            [b] => 8
            [c] => 9
        ]
]
```

## Basic Operations

### Records

#### Add new records

```php
$df->addRecord([
    'a' => 42,
    'b' => 42,
]);

// equivalent to
$df[] = [
    'a' => 42,
    'b' => 42,
]);


// Multiples records
$df->addRecords([
    [
    'a' => 42,
    'b' => 42,
    ],
    [
    'a' => 42,
    'b' => 43,
    ],
]);
```

#### Edit Record
```php
$df->updateRecord(
    position: 42,
    recordArray: [
    'a' => 42,
    'b' => 42,
    ]
);

// equivalent to
$df[42] = [
    'a' => 42,
    'b' => 42,
]);
```

#### Unset Record(s)
```php
$df->removeRecord(position: 42);
unset($df[42]); // equivalent

// equivalent to
$df->filter(fn(array $record, int $position): bool => $position !== 42);
```


### Iterating overs records

#### Counting Records
Counting records:
```php
count($df);
$df->count(); // equivalent
```

#### Iterating over rows:
```php
foreach ($df as $i => $row) {
   echo $i.': '.implode('-', $row).PHP_EOL;
}
--------------------------
0: 1-2-3
1: 4-5-6
2: 7-8-9
```

### Columns

#### Add Column / Remove Column

Columns (attributes) are automatically created when a record contains them for the first time.
You can also create them manually at any time.

```php
$df->addColumn('a');
```

```php
$df->removeColumn('a');
$df->col('a')->remove(); // equivalent
```

#### Getting column name/objects
```php
$df->columnsNames()
--------------
[
    [0] => a
    [1] => b
    [2] => c
]
```

```php
$df->columns()
--------------
[
    [0] => #ColumnRepresentation Object
    [1] => #ColumnRepresentation Object
    [2] => #ColumnRepresentation Object
]
```

```php
$column = $df->col('a')
$column->name; // 'a'
```

#### Rename Column
```php
$col = $df->col('colName')->rename('newName');

$col->name; // 'newName'
$col->getName(); // 'newName'

```

#### Get column as DataFrame
```php
$df->col('colName')->asDataFrame;

// equivalent to

$df->col('colName')->asDataFrame();

```


## Advanced editions

### Applying functions to rows:
```php
$df = $df->apply(function ($row, $index) {
    $row['a'] = $row['c'] + 1;
    return $row;
});
```

### Applying functions to columns directly:
```php
$df->col('a')->apply(fn (mixed $value, int $position) => $el + 3);
```

### Set value for each record in column
```php
$df->col('a')->set(42);
```

### Set DataFrame (single column) to column
```php
$df->col('a')->set(new Dataframe([
    [1],
    [2],
    [3],
]));
```

### Set Column to Column
```php
$df->col('a')->set($df->col('b')->asDataFrame);
```


## Stats modules for a columns

### Natives Modules

#### Average
`sum / count` _where count of non empty and numeric properties_

```php
$df->col('a')->average();
$df->col('a')->average; # equivalent
```

#### Count
Count of non empty and numeric properties.

```php
$df->col('a')->count();
$df->col('a')->count; # equivalent
```

#### Sum
Where non empty and numeric properties

```php
$df->col('a')->sum();
$df->col('a')->sum; # equivalent
```

### Extend yourself
_TO DO_


## Types

### Convert data to a type (oneshoot)
```php
$df->col('a')->type(DataType::INT);
```

### Keep an active conversion for a column

#### Set it
```php
$df->col('a')->enforceType(DataType::INT);
```

#### Remove it
```php
$df->col('a')->enforceType(null); # Note that data already converted, only the following additions we be concerned.
```



Manipulating DataFrame using SQL:
```php
$df = DataFrame::fromArray([
    ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3],
    ['a' => 4, 'b' => 5, 'c' => 6],
    ['a' => 7, 'b' => 8, 'c' => 9],
]);

$df = Builder::query($df, "

SELECT
  a,
  b
FROM dataframe
WHERE a = '4'
  OR b = '2';

");

print_r($df->toArray());
```

```php
Array
(
    [0] => Array
        (
            [a] => 1
            [b] => 2
        )

    [1] => Array
        (
            [a] => 4
            [b] => 5
        )

)
```

```php
$df = DataFrame::fromArray([
    ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3],
    ['a' => 4, 'b' => 5, 'c' => 6],
    ['a' => 7, 'b' => 8, 'c' => 9],
]);

$df = Builder::query($df, "

UPDATE dataframe
SET a = c * 2;

");

print_r($df['a']->to_array());
```

```php
Array
(
    [0] => Array
        (
            [a] => 6
        )

    [1] => Array
        (
            [a] => 12
        )

    [2] => Array
        (
            [a] => 18
        )

)
```
