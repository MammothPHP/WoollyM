# WoollyM: PHP Dataframes for Data Analysis library

WoollyM is a PHP library for data analysis. It can be used to represent tabular data from various sources _(CSV, database, JSON, Excel...)_. The unified API can then be used easily to browse, analyze, modify, and export data in a variety of formats, we try to provide a very playful, modern, expressive, and user-friendly interface. This API is also modular and extensible, so you can easily add your own calculation and exploration methods.

Performances are optimized to be as light as possible on RAM during operations (input, output, read, write, stats, copy, clone), this is done using - internally - complex iterators and optimization preferring RAM over speed (even if we try to be fast also). The storage engine uses a modular storage system, if the default PhpArray driver uses RAM, the use of a database driver (such as the PDO driver) theoretically allows you to work on extremely large datasets. Using appropriate drivers, you can also write - for example - directly to the database (add, update) using the **Wolly** API.

## Installation

### Using Composer:

```sh
composer require mammothphp/woollym
```

### Requirements
 - PHP 8.3 or higher
 - php_mbstring extension

## Note on architecture
- **Wolly** is extendable, or at least he was trying to get used to the idea.
- Data are stored in `data-drivers` that are modules. Currently **Wolly** offer 2 natives modules _(the default PhpArray and PdoSql)_ but you can create your own _(without fork)_. Modules can limit some functionnality but they don't change the public API.
- Statements aggregate function _(like sum, count, max...)_ are modules, most current as offer natively, but you can had your own _(without fork)_
- `Builder` API is used to to create or export a DataFrame from an external sources _(file, database, string...)_ This results in things like  `$df = XLSX::fromFile($path)->import()`.
  - To keep the API as cute as possible for the most common cases, this is different for import/export with an `Array` (or `Traversable`).
  - Builder are simple (and optimized) wrapper on top of DataFrame. You can create your own builder _(using the asbtract class `Builder` or not)_.
  - Builders should not be confused with `data-drivers`, as the associated methods are always distinct. For example, the PDO Builder will not create a DataFrame using the PdoSql driver to browse or modify the underlying database. In this case, you need to create a DataFrame directly linked to the driver.

## Principles

- A `Record` is similar to a line in a spreadsheet.
    - A `Record` can contain from none _(empty record)_ to several `Columns`.
    - The default behavior of API is to return no entry for non-existent columns in the `Record`. But options allow you to virtually return a NULL value if necessary.
    - Each record has a unique key. Generated on the **Wolly** side _(more specifically by the data-driver used)_. Currently only integer are supported.
    - Each record `Column` (property) contain a value. Can be of any PHP type (and `null`) on the default data-driver.
- A `Column` represents a property common to several records, and is similar to a column in a spreadsheet.
  - `Columns` can be added manually or dynamically (a new `Record` contains a new column) at any time.
  - `Columns` are represented to the user by case-sensitive string names.
  - It is not currently possible to reorder columns, but this should never matter. But it's possible to delete it.
  - It's possible to interact specifically with a column using the `$df->col('colName')` API, under the hood this returns an augmented Select statement with specific methods, this also opens the way to higher optimized performance with compatible drivers.

- The royal road to a modified copy of a DataFrame is the API `$df->copy()` but it's not the only way because some magical methods are also available elsewhere for practical reasons.
- The perfect way work on a filtered portion of the DataFrame without copy it is the API `$df->select()`.

## Instantiation (basic)

### Instantiating from an array:

```php
$arr = [
    ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3],
    ['a' => 4, 'b' => 5, 'c' => 6],
    ['a' => 7, 'b' => 8, 'c' => 9],
];

$df = DataFrame::fromArray($arr);

// equivalent
$df = new DataFrame($arr);
```

### Import or export from/to an external source
_To limit external dependencies, some modules could require a separate `composer require`. Please consult the instructions for each of the needed modules.__

### Extracting the underlying two-dimensional array:

```php
$myArray = $df->toArray();
print_r($myArray);
```

```php
[
    [0] => [
            [a] => 1
            [b] => 2
            [c] => 3
        ]

    [1] => [
            [a] => 4
            [b] => 5
            [c] => 6
        ]

    [2] => [
            [a] => 7
            [b] => 8
            [c] => 9
        ]
]
```

## Basic Operations

### Records

#### Add new records

```php
$df->addRecord([
    'a' => 42,
    'b' => 42,
]);

// equivalent to
$df[] = [
    'a' => 42,
    'b' => 42,
];


// Multiples records
$df->addRecords([
    [
    'a' => 42,
    'b' => 42,
    ],
    [
    'a' => 42,
    'b' => 43,
    ],
]);

// Equivalent, but compatible with Iterable, DataFrame, Array
$otherDf = new DataFrame([
    [
    'a' => 42,
    'b' => 42,
    ],
    [
    'a' => 42,
    'b' => 43,
    ],
]);

$df->append($otherDf);
```

#### Edit Record
```php
$df->updateRecord(
    position: 42,
    recordArray: [
      'a' => 42,
      'b' => 42,
    ]
);

// equivalent to
$df[42] = [
    'a' => 42,
    'b' => 42,
]);
```

#### Unset Record(s)
```php
$df->removeRecord(position: 42);

// equivalent
unset($df[42]);

// also equivalent
$df->filter(fn(array $record, int $position): bool => $position !== 42);
```



### Iterating over records

#### Counting Records
Counting records:
```php
count($df);
$df->count(); // equivalent
```

#### Iterating over rows:
```php
foreach ($df as $key => $record) {
   echo $key.': '.implode('-', $record).PHP_EOL;
}
--------------------------
0: 1-2-3
1: 4-5-6
2: 7-8-9
```

### Columns

#### Add Column / Remove Column

Columns (attributes) are automatically created when a record contains them for the first time.
You can also create them manually at any time.

```php
$df->addColumn('a');
```

```php
$df->removeColumn('a');
$df->col('a')->remove(); // equivalent
```

#### Getting column name/objects
```php
$df->columnsNames()
--------------
[
    [0] => a
    [1] => b
    [2] => c
]
```

```php
$df->columns()
--------------
[
    [0] => #ColumnRepresentation Object
    [1] => #ColumnRepresentation Object
    [2] => #ColumnRepresentation Object
]
```

```php
$df->hasColumn('a'); // true / false
$df->mustHaveColumn('a')->selectAll()... // Throw MammothPHP\WoollyM\Exceptions\InvalidSelectException or return $df
``

```php
$column = $df->col('a'); // return ColumnRepresentation object
$column->name; // 'a'
```

#### Rename Column
```php
$col = $df->col('colName')->rename('newName');

$col->name; // 'newName'
$col->getName(); // 'newName'
```

#### Get column as DataFrame
```php
$newDf = $df->col('colName')->import();
```

### Data Overview

#### Head
```php
$arr = $df->head(length: 3);

// To Be
[
    ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3],
    ['a' => 4, 'b' => 5, 'c' => 6],
    ['a' => 7, 'b' => 8, 'c' => 9],
]

$arr = $df->head(length: 3, offset: 1, columns:['a','c']);

// To Be
[
    ['a' => 4,  'c' => 6],
    ['a' => 7,  'c' => 9],
    ['a' => 10, 'c' => 12],
]
```

## Logic and Philosophy

Three main access paths:
```php
$df->select('colNameA')->whereColumnEqual('colB', 42); // Return a new Select object
$df->copy()->unique(onColumns: 'colA'); // Return a new DataFrame contaning unique value from column A
$df->append($iterable); // Return $df (self)
```

* The `Select` object represents a statement to explore au subset of data corresponding to selection and doing stats with them. You can build them using a SQL-like constructor. They offer some commodity helpers methods to modify or copy directly the selected data, but it's not its main purpose.
* The `Copy` object offers an API to return a NEW DataFrame without modifying anything from the original DataFrame. It's also possible to export a Select object to a new DataFrame.
* Even if it's possible to modify a DataFrame using some methods from the Select object to apply to a selection. Most modifiers are directly accessible from the DataFrame object.


## The Select Statement

### The three different types of Select statements
```php
$df->select('colA', 'colB'): Select // Return Select
$df->selectAll(): SelectAll // With all columns, and keep the * selection in returned select object even if columns are aded or deleted to the dataframe.
$df->col('colA'): ColunRepresentation // A classic select with extra methods to rename, remove, clone, type the selected column.
```

### Filter & Limit the Select statements
Create a statement containing 2 two columns, where columnB is > 42, limit to 100 rows but start Ã  offset 10.

```php
$stmt = $df->select('column1','colum2')
    ->where(fn($record, $recordKey) => $record['columnB'] > 42)
    ->limit(100)
    ->offset(10);
```

Or select all column
```php
$stmt = $df->selectAll();
```

Complex where statement
```php
$stmt = $df->selectAll()->where(fn($r) => true)->and(...)->or(...)->or()->and();
```

is SQL equivalent to:
```sql
WHERE contition AND (condition OR condition OR condition) AND condition
```

Simpler Where clause
```php
$stmt = $df->selectAll()->whereColumnEqual('colA', 42);
$stmt = $df->selectAll()->whereKeyBetween(1, 42);
```

Statement are Traversable
```php
foreach($df->selectAll()->where(fn($r) => $r) as $recordKey => $record) {
    // ...
}
```

### Copy from a Select Statement
Return the result as a new DataFrame object:
```php
$newDf = $df->select('colA','colC')->whereColumnEqual('colB', 42)->export();
```

Or directly to an array:
```php
$newArr = $stmt->toArray();

// equivalent to (but slower)
$newArr = $stmt->export()->toArray();
```

### Aggregate stats function
_(non-exhaustive documentation)_

```php
$stmt = $df->selectAll();

$stmt->countRecords(); // count number of records in the statement
$stmt->count(); // count each value in selection
$stmt->countDistinct(); // count distinct value for of each records in statement
$stmt->size(); // count value in selection including null value
$stmt->sum(); // sum all numeric value of each records in statement
$stmt->mean(); // average numeric value in selection
$stmt->min(); // min value (numeric)
$stmt->max(); // max value (numeric)
```

## Copy
> [!WARNING]
> Copy operations are not yet well optimized about memory consumption. Some of them have the potential to do so significantly in the future; others won't really be able to.

> [!NOTE]
> Clone the DataFrame then use equivalent modifier can be more efficient about memory consumtpion than the copy. Depending of the data-driver used and the PHP Copy-on-write feature. **Wolly** has a good PHP cloning support.

```php
// To a new Data Frame
$df->copy()->....

// To a custom dataFrame (useful for alternatives data-drivers)
$newDf = new DataFrame(dataDriver: $pdoSqlDriver);
$df->copy(to: $newDf)->...
```


### Filter
```php
$df = DataFrame::fromArray([
    ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3],
    ['a' => 4, 'b' => 5, 'c' => 6],
    ['a' => 7, 'b' => 8, 'c' => 9],
]);

$df->filter(static function (array $row, int $key) {
    return $row['a'] > 4 || $row['a'] < 4;
});

expect($df->toArray())
    ->toBe([
        ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3],
        ['a' => 7, 'b' => 8, 'c' => 9],
    ]);
```

### Unique
```php
    $df = DataFrame::fromArray([
        ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3],
        ['a' => 1, 'b' => 3, 'c' => 4],
        ['a' => 2, 'b' => 4, 'c' => 5],
        ['a' => 2, 'b' => 4, 'c' => 6],
        ['a' => 3, 'b' => 5, 'c' => 7],
        ['a' => 3, 'b' => 5, 'c' => 8],
    ]);

    expect($df->copy()->unique('a')
        ->toArray())
        ->toBe([
            ['a' => 1],
            ['a' => 2],
            ['a' => 3],
        ]
    );

    expect($df->copy()->unique(['a', 'b'])
        ->toArray())
        ->toBe([
            ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2],
            ['a' => 1, 'b' => 3],
            ['a' => 2, 'b' => 4],
            ['a' => 3, 'b' => 5],
        ]
    );
```

## Modifiers

### Modification to rows

#### Applying functions to each row
```php
$df->apply(function ($row, $index) {
    $row['a'] = $row['c'] + 1;
    return $row;
});
```

#### preg_replace
```php
    $df = new dataFrame([
        ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3],
        ['a' => 4, 'b' => 5, 'c' => 6],
        ['a' => 7, 'b' => 8, 'c' => 9],
    ]);
    
    $df->preg_replace('/[1-5]/', 'foo');

    df->toArray();
    // To Be:
    [
        ['a' => 'foo', 'b' => 'foo', 'c' => 'foo'],
        ['a' => 'foo', 'b' => 'foo', 'c' => 6],
        ['a' => 7, 'b' => 8, 'c' => 9],
    ]);
```

#### filter
_TO DOCUMENT_

#### applyIndexMap
_TO DOCUMENT_

#### sortValues

#### sortColumn
_TO DOCUMENT_

### Modification to a Selection

#### Applying functions to a selection directly
```php
$df->col('a')->apply(fn (mixed $value, int $position) => $value + 3);
```

#### Set a value for each record in a column
```php
$df->col('a')->set(42);
```

#### Set DataFrame (single column) to a column
```php
$df->col('a')->set(new Dataframe( [[1],[2],[3]] ));
```

#### Set Column to a Column
```php
$df->col('a')->set($df->col('b')->asDataFrame);
```


## Types Data

**Two ways:**
1. Converts pre-existing data once only 
2. Converts pre-existing data and forces the type of future data
   1. And force the future data to be typed since submission
   2. Or silently convert untyped future data

### Convert data to a type (one shot)
```php
$df->col('a')->type(DataType::INT);
```

### Keep an active conversion for a column

#### Set it
```php
$df->col('a')->enforceType(DataType::INT);
```

#### Remove it
```php
$df->col('a')->enforceType(null); # Note that data already converted, only the following additions we be concerned.
```

## Manipulating Data using SQL

### Copy DataFrame from SQL
```php
$df = DataFrame::fromArray([
    ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3],
    ['a' => 4, 'b' => 5, 'c' => 6],
    ['a' => 7, 'b' => 8, 'c' => 9],
]);

$resultingDf = $df->copy()->query(" SELECT
                        a,
                        b
                        FROM dataframe
                        WHERE a = '4'
                        OR b = '2';
                    ");

// $resultingDf To Be:
[
    0 => ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2],
    1 => ['a' => 4, 'b' => 5]
]
```


## Use Data Driver to explore external sources or to overcome technical limitations on major datasets
> [!WARNING]
> Non-default data drivers are still highly experimental and unfinished. The drivers interface and API will also be modified.

### Natively provided drivers
|Driver|Comment|Memory Usage|Perf. (write access)|Perf. (random access)|Perf. (mass read)|Aggregate Functions
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
| PhpArray | The default driver | Maximal, all the data stay in ram memory. PHP opy-on-write capacity are limited in context | Very Fast | Very Fast | Vert Fast | Very Fast | Moderately slow, some of them can cause huge memory usage (unique value...)
| PdoSql | _(Experimental)_ Interacting with a database with any PHP PDO driver available | Very low, theoritically infinite | Slow | Very Slow | Medium | Slow (some function can be further optimized)

### Aggregate Function optimized on driver side (performance)
__NOT YET IMPLEMENTED__


### Use specific drivers (PdoSql example)
```php
$tableName = 'testTable';
$primaryKey = 'id';

$pdo = new PDO('sqlite::memory:');
$pdo->exec("CREATE TABLE  {$tableName}  ({$primaryKey} INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, a TEXT, b TEXT, c TEXT);");

$PdoDriver = new PdoSql(db: $pdo, table: $tableName, keyColumn: $primaryKey);

$df = new DataFrame(dataDriver: $PdoDriver);
```


### Implement your custom drivers for WollyM
__TODO__
